# AGENTS

## Repository overview
- This repository hosts a small collection of experimental alias scripts and browser automations intended for iterative testing.

## Workflow guidance for agents
- Keep changes experimental and low-conflict by avoiding invasive restructuring unless explicitly requested.
- Do not introduce legacy layers, migration shims, or compatibility scaffolding unless the user specifically asks for them.
- Maintain alignment between this file and `AGENTS_CHANGELOG.md`; whenever you update one, ensure the other reflects the same context.
- Follow repository-wide conventions described here for all files within this project root.
